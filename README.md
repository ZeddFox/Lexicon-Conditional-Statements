1. Purpose
Write business logic using conditional statements.

2. Theory
We have used the ternary operator for conditional logic. Now we will start
using if statements and switch statements. You might use one of these
statements for solving all your conditional logic, but after a while you
might develop a feel for when one is better than the other. You can use the
ternary operator inside if and switch statements with good results, but
rarely combine if and switch statements.

3. Assignments
  Try to finish these four assignments during the day. Still, you have until
  Friday lunch to hand them in. Upload your solutions to GitHub and share
  the repository URL.
  1.
  Make a value-added tax method for a café business. The method should
  take a string value indicating one of three product options and a decimal
  value representing the price of the product. The method should return the
  value added tax (VAT) calculated.
  The café on occasions sells music entertainment. The VAT is 6 percent.
  The café sells food. The VAT is 12 percent.
  The café sells alcohol. The VAT is 25 percent.
  2.
  Make a method calculating the price when signing up for a gym
  membership. The method should take an int value indicating the age of
  the signee and a bool value indicating a wish for premium membership.
  Persons below the age of 19 and above the age of 64 pay 2200 for their
  membership. All else pay 3100. The premium membership is a straight 300
  amount on top of what the signee already will pay. The method should
  return the full amount payable for the signee.
  3.
  Use a switch statement to make a calculator method that takes a string
  value indicating the mathematical operation and two double values as
  parameters. The method returns the result of the operation, which should
  at least include adding, subtracting, multiplying and dividing.
  4.
  Make a menu options method that takes one of the following options as a
  string value parameter:
  - help, add, delete, edit, find, list
  The method should not return any value, but for the option chosen, print
  out a unique and appropriate message using Console.WriteLine().
